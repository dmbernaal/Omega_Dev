# TO DO:

# learn about spectrograms in general
# learn about spectrograms in finance
# normalize our price with a tanh(diff)
    # other normalization techniques? 
    # larger frequency scales may benefit more - in terms of our spectrogram
# convert our time series into numpy array - will feed into timeseries object
# build scripts to create spectrogram images in time-window
