# OmegaDev
Welcome to the development repository for **OmegaIndex**. Given this project is currently under development and highly experimental for the time-being, all the source code in the Development repository will be open to the public. 

That being said, there are a few models, techniques which are not pushed. 

This repository will contain individual custom scripts, data mining techniques, and experimental CNN & RNN architectures on classification and regression tasks for the **environmental ensemble** of the OmageIndex. 

To navigate just click on the ```Model_``` directory. 

Each ```Model_``` will contain jupyter notebooks you can run on your local machine or on the cloud. For development, each notebook and model has been run on a local machine with a **RTX2070-MaxQ Design**.
